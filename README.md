# _Support library_ for using De Bruijn levels

## Introduction

_De Bruijn levels_ is a measure in lambda terms for variables. Suppose an initial natural number `k`, a lambda term `t` and a variable `x` presents in `t`, the level of `x` is the number of abstraction encountered between the root of the term and the associated abstraction of `x` added to `k`.

```ocaml
(* For instance, in the following term, if we start with k = 0 then the level of x is 0. *)
fun x -> x

(* In the following case, if k = 0 then the level of x is 0 and the level of y is 1. *)
fun x -> fun y -> x + y
```

The initial natural number can be understood as the number of free variables.

```ocaml
(* In the expression below y is free, then we start with k = 1 and the level of x is 2. *)
fun x -> x + y
```

First consequence of that, levels of bound variables depend on the initial natural number `k`. Second consequence of that, the meaning of a term depends on `k`.

These levels are used in a formalism to represent variables. It gives an order and a unique name for variables (except in two branches of an application) which avoids variable capture.

```ocaml
(* The first expression is an usual lambda-term, the second one is its level representation. *)
fun x -> (fun y -> x y) x)
fun -> (fun -> 0 1) 0)
```

Although this representation is much less known than the _De Bruijn indices_ representation, there are some useful characteristics. Among them, we can use levels into structures without binders which is not the case with indices.

This library is a collection of interfaces, implementations and functions that can help you in yours use of De Bruijn levels.

## Updates

### February 28, 2024

We simplify the use of map by adding `Make` module for each possible `Map`. On top of that, a new map with basic keys and leveled data is implemented.

Here are the details:

- [MapLevelInterface](theories/Interface/MapLevelInterface.v) has new interfaces named `ShiftValidMapDETInterface`, `StrongShiftValidMapDETInterface`, `ShiftValidFullMapDETInterface` and `StrongShiftValidFullMapDETInterface`. Those maps have basic keys and leveled data. The only requirement on __keys__ is that __they have to be ordered__.
- An implementation of two among the four new interfaces are findable in [MapETLevel](theories/Implementation/MapETLevel.v)
- For an easier use of map modules, `Make` modules are findable in [MapETLevel](theories/Implementation/MapETLevel.v). Those `Make` modules only ask the key type and the data type.
- Internal module `OP.P` in `Map` is now directly included in the main module when instantiated with a `Make` module.
- __Removing `MapOTLevel` and its interface__.

### February 23, 2024

`Map` interfaces and implementations required elements that implemented `OrderedType`. For an easier use of its, this required property has been weakened and now requires `EqualityType`. Thus, there is modification mainly in `Map` interfaces and implementations but also in the `Level` interface and the `PairLevel` implementation.
On top of that, most of the module type names for `Map` have _changed_.

Here are the details:

- `MapLevel` is now split in two files [MapETLevel](theories/Implementation/MapETLevel.v) and [MapOTLevel](theories/Implementation/MapOTLevel.v) as follows:
  - [MapETLevel](theories/Implementation/MapETLevel.v) contains all implementation with data that implements `EqualityType`
  - [MapOTLevel](theories/Implementation/MapOTLevel.v) contains all implementation with data that implements `OrderedType`
- `MapOT` and `MapOTInterface` are now [MapExt](theories/Mapkit/MapExt.v) and [MapExtInterface](theories/Mapkit/MapExtInterface.v)
- [LevelInterface](theories/Interface/LevelInterface.v) contains new module types for elements that implements `DecidableType` and `EqualityType`. Also, the __minimum constraint for elements__ that used those module types are now the constraint of `EqualityType`.
- In [MapETLevel](theories/Implementation/MapETLevel.v), [MapOTLevel](theories/Implementation/MapOTLevel.v), [MapLevelInterface](theories/Interface/MapLevelInterface.v), [SetLevelInterface](theories/Interface/SetLevelInterface.v) and [SetLevel](theories/Implementation/SetLevel.v), the extension name __`WithLeibniz`__ is now contracted in __`WL`__
- In [PairLevel](theories/Implementation/PairLevel.v), there is now several implementations for `EqualityType` and `OrderedType` elements
- In [MapOTLevel](theories/Implementation/MapOTLevel.v) and [MapLevelInterface](theories/Interface/MapLevelInterface.v), the extension name __`Data`__ is now contracted in __`D`__
- Documentation is not updated for now

## Installation instructions

To Build and install manually, do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JordanIschard/DeBrLevel.git

cd DeBrLevel
dune build @install 
```

> [!NOTE]
> The package is not submitted yet, but we have great hope to create an opam package and add our project to the [coq community repository](https://github.com/coq-community).
